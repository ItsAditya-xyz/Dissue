## Insights into the project 🔎
I built this webApp to demonstrate knowledge. This app was built using different things like ReactjS, Tailwindcss, Flask, Firebase and more. This application supports user authenticatio using firebase.Users are able to create a new account using their email address and can then sign in to save details of a student in a specific class.
